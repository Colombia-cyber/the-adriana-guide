I've drafted a short "thank you" message collection you can add to your README or include as a separate THANKS.md. Below is a ready-to-use Markdown file with multiple variations (one-liner, README/footer paragraph, contributor merge message, sponsor message, and a Spanish version). You can copy the section you prefer into your README or add this file to the repo.

````markdown name=THANKS.md
# Thank you

Use any of the messages below in your README, project footer, or contributor communications.

## Short (one-liner)
Thanks ‚Äî your support and contributions made this project possible. üôè

## README / Project footer (short paragraph)
Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs contributed, reported issues, or tried the project. Your feedback and pull requests help this project improve ‚Äî we appreciate your time and support!

## Contributor / PR merge message
Huge thanks for your contribution! Your work helped move this project forward. We appreciate your time, thoughtful changes, and tests ‚Äî welcome as a contributor and looking forward to more collaboration.

## Sponsor / donor message (slightly more formal)
Thank you for supporting this project. Your generosity enables ongoing maintenance, improvements, and community support. We‚Äôre grateful for your trust and commitment.

## Spanish (para README o comunidad hispanohablante)
¬°Gracias a todos por sus contribuciones y apoyo! Sus reportes, PRs y comentarios hacen que el proyecto mejore cada d√≠a.

## How to add to README
Copy the preferred message and paste it into your README where you want the acknowledgement to appear, for example:

```markdown
## Acknowledgements

Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs contributed, reported issues, or tried the project. Your feedback and pull requests help this project improve ‚Äî we appreciate your time and support!
```

If you want, I can create or open a pull request that:
- Adds this THANKS.md file to the repository, and/or
- Inserts the selected message into the project's README.md directly.

Tell me which option (add THANKS.md or insert into README) and which message you'd like placed, and I'll proceed.
